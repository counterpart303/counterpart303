### whatever
you can call me & refer me as whatever you want, any names & pronouns, i barely care about it  

### i'm an adult 
age range 18-99, good luck trying to guess- so minors dni! i'm always at 18+ servers so like what are you doing here D:

### whisper to interact with me, i highly encourage!  
yes, i might just walk around and observe others so it's not always necessary, but frequently i'm not paying attention to my surroundings as i may be: listening to music, playing another game, talking to my friend on the party chat with my screen fully zoomed in, drawing, really locked in making an avatar, or doing something actually productive. anyways, a nice interaction is always welcome!

### i'm autistic
which means my social skills are greatly nerfed (but my shyness is buffed, funnily enough), so pardon if i act awkward/dry. i don't mind c+h; in fact, i'd appreciate it! & i don't mind getting covered, but sometimes i just like to see my dumb pixel horse nomming on a piece of cake, so don't insist too much on it  haha
